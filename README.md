ClearSansAlternateGlyphs
========================

SVG files for glyphs intended to work with Intel Clear Sans.

Intel Clear Sans is my body copy font of choice for most things ePub but it is
lacking small-caps variant.

My intention is to create small-caps variants for the Regular and Bold weights
with both the Upright and Italic variants.

There also are some picture glyphs I often use with CSS and ::before with
hyperlinks to give a visual indication about the link. I will be adding those
too where the existing picture glyphs in Intel Sans do not suit my needs.

The asterik character will be lowered and possibly borrowed from Fira Sans so
that it is centered nicely between two lower-case small-caps letters.

Only the SVG files will be here, ready for import into FontForge. I will not
be hosting font files.

This will take a while to complete.
